Use sha256sum to check that output is same as reference output

The output should contain 1 end-line characters
New line characters might cause problems. If sha256sum is different, check content of file.

I used this file (generated by `./create_measurements.sh 1000000000`) to test:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEyNw4M453n0tnuaAm9nwaCiLydQYnpo/view?usp=sharing

To run, just download the file above, extract, then `./run_cpp.sh`
To run with a different number of threads, just `./run_cpp.sh 32`

# Main indeas:
- Unsigned int overflow hashing: cheapest hash method possible.
- SIMD hashing
- SIMD for string comparison in hash table probing
- Parse number as int instead of float 
- Notice properties of actual data
- + 99% of station names has `length <= 16`, use compiler hint + implement SIMD for this specific case. If length > 16, use a fallback => still meet requirements of `MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 100`
- + `-99.9 <= temperature <= 99.9` guaranteed, use branchless code using this property
- Use mmap for fast file reading
- Use multithreading for both parsing the file, and aggregating the data
- Other random tricks (intentional ordering of variable assignments)
