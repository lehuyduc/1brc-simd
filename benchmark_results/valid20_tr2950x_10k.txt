// HUGE VARIANCE WHEN RUNNING AT MAX CORES COUNT ON 2950X. Especially in valid19 version
// Interesting topic to look into. Maybe it's because of AMD chiplet design?
// Threads are assigned randomly, so if we get unfortunate assignment (2 threads working on the same L3 cache region),
// but assigned to opposite core cluster, then performance drops.
